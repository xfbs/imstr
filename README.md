This crate offers a cheaply cloneable and sliceable UTF-8 string type. It is
inspired by the [`bytes`] crate, which offers zero-copy byte slices, and the
[`im`] crate which offers immutable copy-on-write data structures. It offers
a standard-library `String`-compatible API.

Internally, the crate uses a standard library string stored in a smart pointer,
and a range into that `String`.  This allows for cheap zero-copy cloning and
slicing of the string. This is especially useful for parsing operations, where
a large string needs to be sliced into a lot of substrings. 

> TL;DR: This crate offers an `ImString`
> type that acts as a `String` (in that it can be modified and used in the same
> way), an `Arc<String>` (in that it is cheap to clone) and an `&str` (in that
> it is cheap to slice) all in one, owned type.

This crate offers a safe API that ensures that every string and every string
slice is UTF-8 encoded. It does not allow slicing of strings within UTF-8
multibyte sequences. It offers `try_*` functions for every operation that can
fail to avoid panics. It also uses extensive unit testing with a full test
coverage to ensure that there is no unsoundness.

## Features

**Efficient Cloning**: The crate's architecture enables low-cost (zero-copy)
clone and slice creation, making it ideal for parsing strings that are widely
shared.

**Efficient Slicing**: The crate's architecture enables low-cost (zero-copy)
slice creation, making it ideal for parsing operations where one large input
string is slices into many smaller strings.

**Copy on Write**: Despite being cheap to clone and slice, it allows for
mutation using copy-on-write. For strings that are not shared, it has an
optimisation to be able to mutate it in-place safely to avoid unnecessary
copying.

**Compatibility**: The API is designed to closely resemble Rust's standard
library [`String`], facilitating smooth integration and being almost a drop-in
replacement. It also integrates with many popular Rust crates, such as
[`serde`], [`peg`] and [`nom`].

**Generic over Storage**: The crate is flexible in terms of how the data is
stored.  It allows for using `Arc<String>` for multithreaded applications and
`Rc<String>` for single-threaded use, providing adaptability to different
storage requirements and avoiding the need to pay for atomic operations when
they are not needed.

**Safety**: The crate enforces that all strings and string slices are UTF-8
encoded. Any methods that might violate this are marked as unsafe. All methods
that can fail have a `try_*` variant that will not panic. Use of safe functions
cannot result in unsound behaviour.

## Example

```rust
use imstr::ImString;

// Create new ImString, allocates data.
let mut string = ImString::from("Hello, World");

// Edit: happens in-place (because this is the only reference).
string.push_str("!");

// Clone: this is zero-copy.
let clone = string.clone();

// Slice: this is zero-copy.
let hello = string.slice(0..5);
assert_eq!(hello, "Hello");

// Slice: this is zero-copy.
let world = string.slice(7..12);
assert_eq!(world, "World");

// Here we have to copy only the part that the slice refers to so it can be modified.
let hello = hello + "!";
assert_eq!(hello, "Hello!");
```

## Optional Features

Optional features that can be turned on using feature-flags.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `serde` | Serialize and deserialize `ImString` fields as strings with the [`serde`] crate. |
| `peg` | Use `ImString` as the data structure that is parsed with the [`peg`] crate. See [`peg-list.rs`](examples/peg-list.rs) for an example. |
| `nom` | Allow `ImString` to be used to build parsers with [`nom`]. See [`nom-json.rs`](examples/nom-json.rs) for an example. |

## Similar

This is a comparison of this crate to other, similar crates. The comparison is
made on these features:

- **Cheap Clone**: is it a zero-copy operation to clone a string?
- **Cheap Slice** 游꼣: is it possibly to cheaply slice a string?
- **Mutable**: is it possible to modify strings?
- **Generic Storage**: is it possible to swap out the storage mechanism?
- **String Compatible**: is it compatible with [`String`]?
